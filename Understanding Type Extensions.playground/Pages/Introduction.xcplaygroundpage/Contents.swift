 ### Introduction
 ![StewartLynch Logo](SickerMe.png)
 A Swift extension is a way to add new functionality to an existing class, struct, enum, or protocol without having to subclass or modify the original code. It allows you to extend the capabilities of a type by adding new methods, properties, or subscripts. Extensions can be used to organize your code, improve readability, and make your code more reusable. They are a powerful feature of the Swift language that can save you time and help you write more efficient and modular code
